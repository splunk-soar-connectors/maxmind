<h2 id="poll_now">POLL NOW</h2>
<p>POLL NOW can be used to investigate what gets run on each poll during ingestion.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: LicenseKey is required to be specified in your asset. It's used to fetch the latest MaxMind database.</p>
<p>For more info on what gets run on each poll, see "Scheduled Polling" below.</p>

<h2 id="scheduled_polling">Scheduled Polling</h2>
<p>This mode is used to schedule a polling action on the asset at regular intervals, which is configured via the INGEST SETTINGS tab of the asset.</p>
<p>
    In the case of Scheduled Polling, on every poll, the app compares the timestamp of the current database with the one on MaxMind server.
    The app will download the database from the server only if the server has a newer database.
    With this check, the app can avoid downloading a duplicate database and stay within the daily MaxMind download limit.
    As of September 14, 2021, each account can perform up to 2,000 total downloads in each 24 hour period.
    For more info, visit <a href="https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-faq/databases-and-database-updates/is-there-a-limit-to-how-often-i-can-download-a-database-from-my-maxmind-account/" target="_blank">here</a>
</p>
<p>
    It's recommended to run the database update every 30 days.
    The schedule of the database update can be found <a href="https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-faq/databases-and-database-updates/how-often-should-i-purchase-geoip2-or-geoip-legacy-database-updates/" target="_blank">here</a>
